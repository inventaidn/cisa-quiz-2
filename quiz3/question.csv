This is a violation of:","Need-to-Know.","Least Privilege.","Segregation of Duties (SoD).","Aesthetic design principles.",2,"The DBA should manage the database, but user account creation should typically be a separate function (e.g., Security Administration) to prevent unauthorized access creation."
87,D5,"The MOST significant risk associated with the use of shared or group accounts is:","Increased network latency.","Loss of individual accountability and difficulty in forensic investigation.","The accounts require more complex passwords.","Violation of the business continuity plan.",1,"Since multiple people use the account, it's impossible to trace specific actions back to a single person."
88,D5,"When evaluating physical access controls to a data center, the IS auditor's PRIMARY focus should be on:","The number of servers in the data center.","Segregation of duties for physical access card issuance and revocation.","The brand of the physical access card reader.","The proximity of the data center to a coffee shop.",1,"Ensuring that card issuance and revocation is controlled and documented prevents unauthorized personnel from retaining access after their need expires."
89,D5,"A Stateful Inspection Firewall is considered superior to a Packet-Filtering Firewall because it:","Is always cheaper to purchase.","Monitors the state of active connections, only allowing inbound traffic that is a response to an outbound request.","Only uses IP addresses for filtering.","Is easier to configure for network administrators.",1,"Stateful inspection adds context (connection state) to the decision process, making it much harder to bypass."
90,D5,"The primary purpose of mandatory vacations for IT personnel in sensitive roles (e.g., security admin, cashiers) is to:","Provide the staff with a better work-life balance.","Reduce the total operational cost of the department.","Force the use of other personnel in the role, potentially detecting fraud or undisclosed control weaknesses.","Comply with international labor laws.",2,"Requiring others to perform the duties increases the likelihood of detecting hidden fraudulent activity or undocumented weaknesses."
91,D5,"Which of the following is an example of a Compensating Control?","A firewall blocking all unauthorized access.","Implementing automated logging and reconciliation reviews to mitigate a lack of Segregation of Duties.","Encryption of all data at rest.","A security guard at the data center entrance.",1,"A compensating control is used to mitigate a risk when a primary control (like SoD) cannot be implemented."
92,D5,"The IS auditor is reviewing controls over laptop data. The MOST effective preventative control against data loss/theft is:","A large sticker on the laptop saying 'Do Not Steal'.","Full disk encryption (FDE).","A daily backup schedule.","Installing a network monitoring tool.",1,"FDE renders the data unreadable if the physical device is lost or stolen."
93,D5,"Which type of control best addresses the risk of unauthorized commands being injected into a web application's database?","Physical security of the server.","Input validation and parameterized queries.","Monthly password changes.","Daily anti-virus scans.",1,"These are preventative application-layer controls (like for SQL Injection) that filter out malicious input."
94,D5,"An IS auditor finds that an organization is using old, known-vulnerable components in its application. This is a failure of:","Sales forecasting.","Configuration and inventory management.","Vendor's financial stability.","The IS Audit Charter.",1,"The organization failed to properly manage and update its components/configuration to a secure baseline."
95,D5,"The primary benefit of using a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) over a Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is that HIDS:","Is always cheaper to operate.","Can monitor and inspect encrypted network traffic after it has been decrypted by the host.","Is easier to deploy organization-wide.","Requires no configuration whatsoever.",1,"HIDS sees traffic inside the host after encryption is removed, and it can inspect local system files and processes."
96,D5,"The PRIMARY purpose of a data-masking solution in a non-production environment is to:","Encrypt all production data before it is backed up.","Ensure that real, sensitive production data is not exposed to developers or testers.","Increase the speed of the application development process.","Comply with the organization's acceptable use policy.",1,"Masking replaces sensitive data with structurally similar but fake data to protect confidentiality."
97,D5,"The IS auditor should be MOST concerned if the firewall configuration is managed by:","The Internal Audit Manager.","The Network Operations team.","The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).","The organization's legal counsel.",1,"Firewall management (Security function) should be segregated from Network Operations to prevent unauthorized network changes that bypass security policy."
98,D5,"To ensure the integrity of software updates downloaded from a vendor, the user should primarily verify the:","File size of the update.","Digital signature or cryptographic hash of the file.","Date the file was created.","Name of the vendor who provided the file.",1,"The hash or signature proves the file has not been tampered with during transmission (integrity)."
99,D5,"Which of the following is a key element of effective security awareness training?","Making the training mandatory for all personnel and tailored to specific job functions.","Making the training optional for senior management.","Providing the training only once upon hiring.","Making the training exclusively focused on technical details.",0,"Mandatory, role-specific training ensures all personnel understand their security responsibilities."
100,D5,"The IS auditor is reviewing the organization's acceptable use policy (AUP). The policy's PRIMARY purpose is to:","Define the organization's overall IT strategic plan.","Establish the budget for IT security technology.","Define the explicit rules and limitations for the use of organizational IT resources by employees.","Describe the organization's network topology.",2,"The AUP sets the boundaries for acceptable behavior when using company assets."
