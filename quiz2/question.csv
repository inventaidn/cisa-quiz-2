86,D5,What is the MOST crucial input for the ongoing review of user access rights within an established security program?,Changes in the organization’s regulatory compliance profile.,"Changes in employee job responsibilities (e.g., promotions, transfers).",The results of the annual penetration test.,The latest vulnerability scan report.,1,"Changes in job responsibilities (e.g., transfer, promotion) are the most frequent cause of 'role creep' and mandate an immediate review of access rights."
87,D5,Which device is considered a 'smart' central point that sends a message only to the required device by looking up its MAC address?,Hub.,Repeater.,Switch.,Router.,2,A Switch is an intelligent device that forwards data only to the intended recipient by reading the MAC address (Layer 2 of the OSI model).
88,D5,"Which type of firewall works at the Application Layer of the OSI model, inspecting the content of the packet to make intelligent decisions about which application-specific commands are allowed?",Packet-filtering firewall.,Application Gateway firewall (or proxy firewall).,Stateful Inspection firewall.,Network Access Control (NAC).,1,An Application Gateway firewall (proxy firewall) operates at the Application Layer (Layer 7) and performs deep packet inspection of the content and application commands.
89,D5,Why is establishing formal ownership the first step in data classification?,To define the encryption standards used for the data.,To ensure the owner is accountable for the risk analysis and protection requirements.,To determine the regulatory compliance requirements.,To select the appropriate access control matrix.,1,The owner must be defined because they are the one accountable for the asset's security and are best placed to help determine its risk and protection needs.
90,D5,An IS auditor is reviewing the access control list (ACL) for a critical server. What is the most common reason for excessive access rights found in an ACL?,Insufficient network bandwidth.,Failure to remove access when an employee changes job roles (role creep).,Lack of multi-factor authentication.,Poor physical security over the server location.,1,"Failure to remove or adjust access when an employee changes roles, leading to the accumulation of unnecessary privileges, is known as 'role creep.'"
91,D5,Which statement best describes the purpose of an IT Security Baseline?,A set of policies governing employee use of the internet.,The minimum security requirements necessary to protect information assets.,The maximum acceptable risk tolerance set by the Board.,A detailed report of all known vulnerabilities in the environment.,1,"An IT Security Baseline is the documented set of minimum security requirements or standards that all systems, networks, and applications must meet."
91,D5,An IS auditor finds that a company's database administrator also has the authority to make changes to application code. This is a violation of:,Least Privilege.,Segregation of Duties (SoD).,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).,Need-to-Know.,1,"This is a clear violation of Segregation of Duties (SoD), as the individual can manipulate the application logic and then control the data within the database."
92,D5,Which of the following is the most significant deficiency in a logical access control environment?,Unencrypted passwords exist in a plain text file.,Shared logon IDs are used for common administrative tasks.,User access rights are only reviewed semi-annually.,The password minimum length is eight characters.,0,Storing unencrypted passwords in a plain text file is a catastrophic failure of basic security and poses the most significant vulnerability to the entire system.
93,D5,"To maintain the integrity of production code, the IS auditor should look for evidence of which control?",All access to the production environment is logged and monitored.,The source code is written in a standard programming language.,The system is backed up weekly.,All changes to production programs require separation of duties (SoD).,3,"Separation of Duties (SoD) for changes to production programs prevents a single person from developing and deploying the code, which is key to maintaining integrity."
94,D5,What is the PRIMARY benefit of implementing a well-defined information classification scheme?,It simplifies data encryption across the entire enterprise.,It helps ensure that security controls are applied commensurate with the data's value.,It reduces the overall cost of data storage.,It guarantees regulatory compliance in all jurisdictions.,1,Classification allows the organization to apply security controls commensurate with the data's value (high value/risk data gets strong controls; low value/risk data gets weaker controls).
95,D5,"An IS auditor finds that the IT department manages security for all systems, but they do not use a formal, documented security policy. This represents a weakness in:",Security technology implementation.,Policy and procedural governance.,Network segmentation.,Business continuity planning.,1,"The lack of a formal, documented security policy indicates a fundamental weakness in the policy and procedural governance framework, regardless of the technology used."
96,D5,An IS auditor finds that an application uses a simple bridge device to connect two separate network segments. The PRIMARY security risk is that:,The bridge will read the MAC address and prevent data flow.,"The segments, now functioning as a single network, may expose sensitive data.",The bridge will direct all traffic to the wrong destination.,The bridge will slow down the network's overall throughput.,1,"A bridge simply connects segments, allowing them to function as a single logical network. If one segment contains sensitive data, this can inadvertently expose it to the less secure segment."
